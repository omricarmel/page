## Keep it simple, stupid.

### starting a blog

Trying to satisfy my endless urge to show people around me the results of my hobbies they don't care about, I have finally decided to whip up a blog.

Who will read this? Probably only people I beg to. But maybe someday someone will find actual value in my passion. In the mean time, I'm sorry i coerced you into reading this my dear friend/family member/girlfriend.


### but how?

To be frank this is not my first attempt at this. A previous iteration is dumped onto an SD card on an old raspberry pi 4B.

But this time I'm not delivering into the drawer. Having a setup compiling everything to static files allows me to easily deploy this onto numerous sites willing to hold on to and serve a bunch of static files. You, my dear reader, were probably sent a link to omricar.ml but behind the scenes i plan to simply open a git repo that serving this on a CI pipeline.


### How is this simple? 

Well it's not. But if the last s in kiss is stupid, it is referring to me. Embracingly, I'm currently typing markdown into vim while having it spellcheck me with `:set spell spelllang=en_us`. I wish i could show you my screen right now but I definitely haven't figured out screenshots.

### The devil you know

Well I'm sure i could have opened up a medium account and have all this setup avoided. But as Ron Swanson from Parks and Recs once said while ordering a family meal of hamburgers "I know what I'm about son" (enter GIF here).

Having built and deployed many sites for various and questionable purposes, typing in markdown and deploying with a git pipeline seems like an elegant solution. I'll definitely need a more frictionless, but for the mean time this will do.

Oh and BTW the compiler that creates a site out and around these markdown posts is Hugo, written in go and compiles quick and with beautiful plugins. shoutout for making this so easy.


All for now,

Omri

p.s figured out the GIFs
